  <h2>Tesla's Career & Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>Arguably one of the most important fathers of electrical engineering, Nikola Tesla shaped the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system. He was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, in the Austrian Empire (modern day Croatia). Here, his significance is recorded to supply a degree of appreciation to his immense contributions. To begin understanding his genius, understanding Tesla as a person is vital. 
    <br> <br> His family background, personal interests, and external influences made him the great inventor we know him as.

        <li><b>Family background</b>
          <p>Nikola Tesla’s father, Milutin, was a Serbian Orthodox priest, a writer, and a well-educated man with a deep appreciation for literature and knowledge. He hoped his son would pursue the same path, but acknowledged Tesla's interest for science and electricity. 
            <br> <br>Tesla’s mother, Georgina, was of Serbian descent and had a profound impact on his early development. She was inventive and had an excellent memory, with a talent for making mechanical devices, which likely influenced Tesla’s later innovations. Tesla was particularly close to his mother, and he once said that many of his ideas and inventive spirit were inherited from her. She also taught him how to observe and analyze the world with a critical eye, inspiring his curiosity in science and engineering. 
              <br> <br> Tesla had four siblings, but only his older brother, Dane, was particularly influential. Unfortunately, Dane died in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was just five years old. This tragic event had a profound impact on Tesla and reportedly contributed to his introverted nature. Tesla’s other siblings were less influential in his life, and he often spoke of his loneliness growing up.</p>
        <li><b>Influence</b>
          <p>Tesla's early education was a mixture of local schooling and private tutoring. He demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics and science at an early age, even though he often struggled with the more traditional aspects of schooling, such as memorization. Tesla was a voracious reader, and his fascination with electricity and mechanical devices grew as he was introduced to new concepts. His childhood interests were nurtured by his family, especially his mother, who would encourage his inventive spirit.  His talent for visualization was extraordinary, allowing him to mentally picture and experiment with complex electrical systems long before he ever constructed them physically. Tesla was also inspired by the works of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell, whose studies in electromagnetism deeply influenced Tesla’s own work.
            <br> <br> Tesla enrolled in the Technical University of Graz in Austria in 1875, where he studied electrical engineering. During his time there, he excelled in his coursework, particularly in the fields of physics and mathematics. Tesla also started to form ideas about alternating current (AC), though his professors and peers were more focused on direct current (DC). However, Tesla did not complete his degree at Graz, and he later claimed that he had been deeply dissatisfied with his education. After facing financial difficulties and personal challenges, he left the university without graduating.After leaving Graz, Tesla briefly attended the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague but did not continue for long. He became more focused on applying his knowledge practically and eventually moved to Budapest, where he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange and made key observations that would later form the basis of his electrical innovations.
