  <h2>Tesla's Career & Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>Nikola Tesla's career was marked by groundbreaking inventions and contributions to science and technology that shaped the modern world. His work, particularly in electrical engineering, has had lasting impacts on the development of electricity, wireless communication, and many other fields. However, his career was also fraught with challenges, including financial difficulties and a lack of widespread recognition during his lifetime.
    <br> <br> Here is a summary of Tesla's key achievements, contributions, and the challenges he faced:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alternating Current (AC) System</b>
          <p>Tesla is best known for his development of the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which revolutionized the way electricity is transmitted and used. He believed that AC was superior to the direct current (DC) system, which was being promoted by Thomas Edison.
              <br> <br> Tesla's AC system became the standard for electrical power transmission, after intense competition with Thomas Edison’s DC system. This became known as the “War of Currents.” Tesla’s AC system was more efficient over long distances, while Edison’s DC system suffered from significant energy loss.</p>
        <li><b>Tesla Coil (1891)</b>
          <p>One of Tesla’s most famous inventions, the Tesla Coil, is a high-voltage transformer that produces high-frequency alternating currents. It played a significant role in advancing radio technology and electrical experiments.
            <br> <br>  The Tesla Coil was used in many of Tesla’s experiments on wireless communication and power transmission. It remains a key component in radio and television technology and is still used in educational demonstrations of high-voltage electricity.
          </p>
        <li><b>X-Ray and Early Research on Electromagnetic Radiation</b></li>
          <p>Tesla’s work in the field of electromagnetism led him to early experiments in X-ray imaging. Though he was not the first to discover X-rays, his research into high-frequency currents and his development of equipment that could produce such rays contributed to the advancement of medical imaging.</p>
            <br> <br> Tesla also researched the effects of electromagnetic fields and their potential uses in various applications, such as communication and energy transmission.
           
         <li><b>The Tesla Turbine</b></li>
            <p>Tesla invented a bladeless turbine that used smooth disks instead of traditional blades to convert fluid energy into mechanical energy. Though not widely adopted during his lifetime, the Tesla turbine demonstrated his innovative thinking in the area of mechanical engineering.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Tesla held over 300 patents throughout his career, including inventions related to neon lighting, remote control, the electric vehicle (he demonstrated a prototype electric car in 1931), and even devices to enhance crop growth through electromagnetic fields. Tesla’s inventive genius was often stymied by his lack of financial resources. While he had powerful backers like J.P. Morgan and George Westinghouse, Tesla often struggled to secure consistent funding to complete his projects. His ambitious ideas, such as wireless power transmission, were often too costly to pursue without proper financial backing.
