  <h2>Personal Life</h2>   
    <ul>
        <li><b>Loneliness and Relationships</b>
          <p>Tesla never married and often spoke about his dedication to his work. He once said, "I do not believe that the neglect of personal relationships has ever harmed a man, though it may have injured his social life."
            <br> <br>Tesla’s mother, Georgina, was of Serbian descent and had a profound impact on his early development. She was inventive and had an excellent memory, with a talent for making mechanical devices, which likely influenced Tesla’s later innovations. Tesla was particularly close to his mother, and he once said that many of his ideas and inventive spirit were inherited from her. She also taught him how to observe and analyze the world with a critical eye, inspiring his curiosity in science and engineering. 
              <br> <br> Tesla had four siblings, but only his older brother, Dane, was particularly influential. Unfortunately, Dane died in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was just five years old. This tragic event had a profound impact on Tesla and reportedly contributed to his introverted nature. Tesla’s other siblings were less influential in his life, and he often spoke of his loneliness growing up.</p>
